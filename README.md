1. THE SECOND PART Of a Discourse concerning IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS.

    _ CHAP. I. Q. Is there any kind of Righteousness expresly said in Scripture to be imputed to Believers? Answ. Yes, proved by Rom. 4.6. from which text together with the context it is also manifested, That forgiveness of sin is that righteousness, which for Christs sake is there said to be imputed to them. A distinction concerning a twofold Non-imputation of sin commended to observation. The matter cleared from an Objection, with the Attestation of several worthy Authors.

    _ CHAP II. Q. What manner of Righteousness is forgiveness of sin? Answ. In order to the resolution of the Question a distinction concerning a twofold Righteousness is premised (the word Righteousness implying sometimes Officium, duty commanded; and sometimes Beneficium, mercy promised:) which distinction being also in other words apt for edification expressed, the Question it self is thereupon plainly determined.

    _ CHAP III. Q. VVhy is Forgiveness of sin in Scripture styled Righteousness, or a person pardoned there said to be Righteous? Answ. The Question for the more clearness of understanding is answered both Negatively and Affirmatively. A Caution to prevent the misconstruction of some places in Scripture, and two Rules suggested as conducing to a right interpretation thereof. A few brief Animadversions upon some passages in Mr. Will. Bradshawes Latin Dissertation concerning Justification.

    _ CHAP. IV. Q. What peculiar Names have certain Modern Authors used to give to the said imputed, or imparted Righteousness (the Non-imputation of sin) whereby to distinguish it from that other kind of righteousness, which doth consist in a practical conformity to the Law of God? Answ. They have distinguished them by such Names, or Epithetes as these, viz. Active and Passive; Negative and Positive; Proper and Improper; Literal and Interpretative; Legal and Pro-legal; to which is added, Primary and Secondary, with the Authors Opinion concerning the fitness of the said diacritical, or distinguishing Titles.

    _ Q. By what distinguishing words is the said Imputed Righteousness styled in Scripture? Answ. It is styled a Righousness without works. Hereupon it being questioned, how, or in what sense it is, or can be so said to be (forasmuch as the expression, a Righteousness without Works, is in sound like the expression, a Righteousness without righteousness) the Question is answered more at large, 1. Negatively, 2. Affirmatively.

    _ CHAP VI. Another distinguishing Phrase, whereby the said imparted or imputed righteousness (forgiveness of sin) expressed in the Writings of S. Paul, is a righteousness of God, and without the Law, the Reasons whereof are specified in the Chapters immediately following.

    _ CHAP. VII. Q. Why is the said imputed righteousness styled the righteousness of God? Answer hereunto, It is answered both Negatively and Affirmatively, What is, and What is not, the Reason thereof.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Q. What Law doth the Apostle mean in styling pardon of sin a righteousness without Law? Answ. In answer hereunto it is specified both what is and is not the reason thereof. A large explication of Phil. 3.9. wherein is manifested what righteousness that is, which he calls his own, and yet doth disown; and a vindication of the said Scripture from the misconstruction of divers Brethren.

    _ CHAP. IX. Further Reasons added to those in Chapter VII. Why the said Righteousness is styled the Righteousness of God: wherein it is commended to observation, that there is a twofold righteousness mentioned in Scripture, one which is so our own, as that it may and must be called the Righteousness of God; and another which is so our own, as that it may not, ought not, to be styled the Righteousness of God: and what these two kinds of Righteousness are, is plainly specified. Whence it is inferred, that Jesus Christ did not, in reference to the justification of a sinner, keep the Law in his stead.

    _ CHAP. X. Q. Why is the said imparted or imputed righteousness of God styled a righteousness without the Law? Answ. The Question is answered, 1. Negatively, What is not: 2. Affirmatively, What are the Reasons thereof.

    _ CHAP. XI. Another Scriptural Title given to remission of sin is, in its being styled the righteousness which is of, by, from, and thorough Faith; divers Reasons whereof are rendred. The Authors Opinion touching the pardonableness of sin, or placability of God in the question, Whether this was any part of the 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, i. e. A thing discoverable by the light of Nature.

    _ CHAP. XII. Q. Whether doth a Sinner need ought more than the righteousness of Christ to justifie him in the sight of God? Answ. Yes. The Authors professed Dissent as from certain other Brethren, so in special from Dr. Grew, late of Coventry, wherein is manifested, that although a Sinner needs nothing of the same kind more than Christs righteousness to the said end, i. e. In genere causae meritoriae, as a meritorious cause; nevertheless (simpliciter loquendo, to speak the truth absolutely) he needs many things, and those of several kinds, to justifie him before God; and what those things are is specified at large.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Q. In what sense is the word (Faith) to be taken in those Scriptures, wherein forgiveness af sin is insinuated to be the fruit or consequent of Faith, and wherein it is styled the righteousness of God which is by Faith? Answ. It is not taken strictly, as excluding all other Evangelical graces in a Sinner, viz. Repentance and sincere Resolution for amendment of life; but in a large sense as comprizing them, these being of the very essence of Faith, as justifying, or as taken (though not in a strict Philosophical, yet) in a Scriptural construction or importance of the word.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Another Scriptural Title given to the said imputed righteousness is in its being styled, The righteousness of the faith of Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised, Rom. 4.11. the whole Verse being opened more at large, and vindicated from mis-interpretation too commonly received. Caution given for a due understanding as well of the Authors full as true meaning, in his asserting Justification or Remission of sin (a righteousness promised in the Law of Faith) to be it which S. Paul doth style the righteousness of God, and which is by faith, the Author in that his assertion must not be understood as excluding, but as supposing and including that other branch or kind of righteousness, which in the Gospel or Law of Faith is commanded.

    _ CHAP. XV. Q. Is there any thing expresly said in Scripture to be imputed to us for righteousnes? Answ. Yes, viz. Faith, it being thus recorded in the Old Testament, Gen. 15.6. and the record thereof produced in the New Testament once by S. James, chap. 2.23. and twice by S. Paul, Gal. 3.6. and Rom. 4.3. in which chapter he doth assert little less than ten times over, that Abrahams faith was imputed to him, and that the like or same specifical faith shall be imputed to us for righteousness, ver. 3, 5, 9, 20, 22, 23, 24.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Q. What is meant by faith in those Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament, wherein it is said to be imputed to Believers for righteousness? Is it to be taken properly for faith it self, or figuratively, i. e. objectively, for Christs righteousness the object of faith? Answ. Properly for the thing faith, or faith it self, the truth of which answer is proved by many reasons, and cleared from certain objections, with the suffrage of the very learned and most industrious Mr R. Baxter, and reflection upon a passage of Dr Grew in his Sermons upon Jer. 23.6.

    _ CHAP. XVII. Q. Whence comes it to pass, that so many very learned and most pious men have so much and miserably mistaken the true meaning of the word [Faith] in its being said to be imputed to Believers for righteousness, they interpreting by faith not to be meant faith, but the righteousness of Christ? Answ. Four things are assigned as the causes of it, wherein much is spoken for the removing of them out of the way of truth, whereby they may no longer obstruct the free current thereof.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. Q. What is it for Faith [the thing it self Faith] to be imputed to Believers for Righteousness? Answ. There being a twofold righteousness, viz. Legal [commanded in the law of works, or innocency,] and evangelical (promised in the law of faith;) and there being also a difference betwixt these two sayings (Faith, is imputed to us 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, instead of righteousness, and 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, To righteousness, this being the Apostles literal expression of the matter;) it is thereupon declared, How faith may be truly conceived and asserted to be imputed to believing sinners, both To Righteousness and instead of Righteousness. The Authors humble opinion touching the genuine sense of the phrase, and the reasons thereof rendred.

    _ CHAP. XIX. Quest. Ʋpon what account, or from what cause, or causes is it, that faith (properly taken) is counted to Believers for righteousness, or proves to them effectually available unto righteousness? Ans. The Question is answered, 1. Negatively, Not ab intrinseco, from ought, which is in the intrinsecal nature of faith, or the value and merit thereof. 2. Affirmatively, The causes assigned being wholly ab extrinseco, viz. Gods mercy, Christs merit and the Gospel-covenant. Hereupon it is made apparent, that those Protestant Writers, who do assert faith it self to be imputed to Believers for or to righteousness, do not dethrone the righteousness of Christ, or set up any branch of mans own righteousness in its stead.

    _ CHAP. XX. Q. Can ought, that is imperfect, possibly be by God imputed to a sinner for, or to righteousness? Answ. Yes. The Authors professed dissent herein from certain other Brethren, whereof two only by name are instanced in, whose words are recited, and a reply made thereunto.

    _ CHAP. XXI. Q. Ʋnder what notion, specifical conceptus, or formal consideration is faith (properly taken) imputed to sinners for, or to righteousness? Answ. The Question is answered at large clearly and distinctly i. e. both Negatively and Affirmatively. An objection answered.

    _ CHAP. XXII. Q. Is there any personal righteousness, which God sees in a sinner himself, upon the intuition whereof God is, or may be said to be moved to justifie him? Answ. Yes, in maintenance of the truth of which answer a copious reply is made to a contrariant passage in Doctor Grews Sermons upon Jer. 23.6.

    _ CHAP. XXIII. Q. By whom is faith imputed to believing sinners for, or unto righteousness? Ans. In answer hereunto that text in Gen. 15.6. is vindicated from the misconstruction of some of the more ancient Rabbins, it being withal asserted, That it is God himself, who doth so impute it: But whether it was imputed to Abraham by God as Benefactor, or else as estimator, or Judge, is left to consideration upon what is said in answer to a Question, which is the subject of the Chapter ensuing.

    _ CHAP. XXIV. Quest. Was not Abraham a Believer and his Faith thereupon actually imputed to him for Righteousness before he believed the promise recorded in Gen. 15.5. and that testimony given to his Faith ver. 6? Answ. Yes: long before, his departure out of his native countrey (Ur of the Caldees) implying not onely a local, but also a moral departure.

    _ CHAP. XXV. Quest. Forasmuch as Abraham was a Believer, and his Faith imputed to him for Righteousness long before that Testimony given to his Faith in Gen. 15.6. How was it true to say, that his believing in the Lord was then, or at that time imputed to him for righteousness? Answ. The Question is answered several ways. A parallel Scripture concerning Noah (Heb. 11.7.) opened, by occasion whereof 4 Questions, with reference to that clause (And he became heir of the righteousness, which is by faith) are proposed and answered, 1. What kind of righteousness is there meant? 2. What is it to be an heir of that kind of righteousness? 3. What was that righteousness, which Noah is there said to have been heir of? or, Wherein did it consist? 4. Why is the said righteousness styled the righteousness, which is by Faith?

    _ CHAP. XXVI. Q. What was the object of that faith of Abrahams, which is said to have been imputed to him for righteousness? Answ. Generally those revelations, which God had imparted to him concerning his divine will, i. e. both Mandati and beneplaciti: both what God himself had promised to do, and also what he had commanded Abraham to do, the prime whereof (both the things commanded and promised) are made instances in; Hereupon six things as observable are commended to consideration, with a reflection upon a passage in that very learned forein Writer, Doctor And. Ryvet.

    _ CHAP. XXVII. Q. VVhat was the object of the faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and other the faithfull Patriarchs of the old world before Abraham was? Answ. Such things as were made known to them by supernatural revelation, which things are summarily said to be Gods Existence and his Beneficence, proved by Heb. 11.6. Hereupon two Questions are proposed and answered, 1. VVhether Gods Existence and Beneficence were not things of natural revelation, or made known by the light of nature? 2. Q. VVhether was it made known to the said Patriarchs before the flood, that God [in Christ, or for Christs sake] was, or would be the Rewarder of them who diligently seek him?

    _ CHAP. XXVIII. Q. What is the object of that Christian faith, which in the New Testament is promised by God to be imputed to sinners for righteousness? Answ. Two remarkable differences in the object of their, and our Christian faith specified, the one styled Modal, the other Material, the object of our Christian faith being of larger extent, than that of the said Patriarchs. A refutation of those who do assert ens incomplexum, i. e. the person of Christ to be the adequate object of justifying faith as justifying, as also of those, who will not extend the object of justifying faith [as justifying] so far as to whole Christ in person, i. e. to Christ as considered in all his Offices, but do restrain it to the formal consideration of him onely as a Priest. Three causes of this mistake in a late learned Latine Author. The suffrage of that most judicious and impartial Author Le-Banch one of the very learned Professors of Divinity in Sedan.

    _ CHAP. XXIX. Q. Is it onely one act, or one kind of acts of faith, or else various acts thereof, and of divers kinds, respectively whereunto it is said, That Abrahams faith was imputed to him for righteousness? Ans. The most noted distinction of two kinds of the acts of faith, styled Elicite and Imperate, being premised, exemplified and explained, the Question it self is perspicuously answered; and this in way of dissent from those Brethren, who instruct sinners to believe, that they are to be justified onely by one act of faith, which act various Authors do use to express by various phrases, some whereof are indeed Scriptural expressions, and some of their own invention. Certain of these Authors are instanced in, and their words being recited, a reply is made thereunto, together with a passage in the larger Catechism of the late Assembly of Divines.

    _ CHAP. XXX. A brief reply to a passage in Doctor Owen, he saying, That in the doctrine by him asserted touching the Imputation of Christs righteousness he hath as good company as the Prelacy and the whole Church of England can afford.
